# 🍽️ Restaurant Reviews Analysis — Sprint 3 (CSE310 Module 3)

Analyze restaurant reviews using Python and NLP techniques to uncover customer sentiment and preferences.

---

## 📌 Overview

As a software engineer, I constantly seek opportunities to sharpen my data analysis and machine learning skills. In this project, I focused on enhancing my understanding of **natural language processing (NLP)** by analyzing restaurant reviews.

The dataset used contains thousands of real customer reviews, along with star ratings and other metadata. It was sourced from the [Kaggle Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

This project aims to:

- Perform **sentiment analysis** on reviews
- Identify **frequently mentioned menu items**
- Discover **what customers value most** in their dining experience
